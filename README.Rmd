This is the public repository for Brad Cannellâ€™s Introduction to R Programming and Data Management Public Repository course at UTHealth. It is still under development. Currently, this repository is for:

1. R code for lab warm-ups.
2. R code for labs.
3. Other files intended to be shared with students and/or the public.
4. Loading practice data sets.


## Installation

You can install the development version of project from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brad-cannell/intro_r_public")
```

Currently, there isn't a reason to install this package. In the future, we imagine that we will use this package to share R code (including functions) and example data sets.
